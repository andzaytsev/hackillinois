He had been awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father\'s military expansion plans. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid empire, ruled Asia Minor, and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the entirety of the Persian Empire.i[â€º] At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River.\n</p>',
