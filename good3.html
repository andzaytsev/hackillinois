	It was translated into vernacular French as early as 1219,[3] and reissued later in the 13th century in modified versions. The later versions excluded the most direct challenges to the monarch's authority that had been <a class="note_show" id="note1_show" style="display: inline;">show note</a><span class="note_container" id="note1_hide" style="display: none;">Good<a class="note_hide" id="note1">(hide note)</a></span>present in the 1215 charter. The charter first passed into law in 1225; the 1297 version, with the long title (originally in Latin) "The Great Charter of the Liberties of England, and of the Liberties of the Forest", still remains on the statute books of England and Wales.[4]

It influenced the early settlers in New England[8] and inspired later constitutional documents, including the United States Constitution.[9]
